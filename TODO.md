TODO
========
This is a list that delineates what is left to be done when it comes to achieving a file structure that matches the standards for open sourced Python projects.

1. Update all README files after the file directory move
4. Check whether we want Python eggs (Mike's initial file structure having individual test folders in parser and converter suggests this, but I went with having a single package.

In setup.py
7. Check that author_email is correct


On the github doc folder
10. Quickstart" documentation (how to quickly install and use your project)
11. A list of non-Python dependencies (if any) and how to install them

For providing a script that users that user (python script [command][input]) create a folder scripts, place them there and set setup.py scripts= ['script name']
