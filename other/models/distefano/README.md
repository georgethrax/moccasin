This was a model provided by Joe DiStefano's group at UCLA in Los Angeles.

Note: the original model appears to be for Octave, which has slightly
different syntax from MATLAB.  The version in thysim_sbml.m has been
modified for MATLAB, and the originaly is in thysim_sbml_original.m.
To see what has been changed, run `diff` on the two files.
