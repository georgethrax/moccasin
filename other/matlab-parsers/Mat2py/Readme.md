#Mat2py 


Mat2py is short for Matlab to Python - a complier designed for translating Matlab script into the code which may run in Python environment directly without any modification. 
<p>Now, it's consist of three main components:the lexer and parser for matlab script language, the code generator which generate corresponding python code. You may use some of these parts in your own project independently under the license.</p>

Notice: mat2py project is in a very early version, so any feedback is expecting :)
