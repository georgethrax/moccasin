# MOCCASIN

*MOCCASIN* stands for *"Model ODE Converter for Creating Awesome SBML INteroperability"*.  MOCCASIN is designed to convert certain basic forms of ODE simulation models written in MATLAB or Octave and translate them into [SBML](http://sbml.org) format.  It thereby enables researchers to convert MATLAB models into an open and widely-used format in systems biology.

MOCCASIN source code and distributions are made available from the MOCCASIN project repository on GitHub:
