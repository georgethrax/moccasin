Examples of ODE models written in MATLAB and Octave
===================================================

This directory contains sample models of biological phenomena, written in MATLAB or Octave.  These are actual models contributed by researchers in the field or obtained from publications.  The MOCCASIN project uses these as examples of models to be converted to SBML.  Not all models are necessarily convertible; rather, this collection of MATLAB/Octave models is meant to illustrate what real-life models look like.
