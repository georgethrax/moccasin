Versioning
----------

This project uses the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) principles for versioning.  The version number has the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-LABEL`. The fields have the following meaning:

* An increment of the major version number, `MAJOR`, represents incompatible API changes.
* An increment of the minor version number, `MINOR`, represents additional functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
* An increment of the patch version number, `PATCH`, represents backwards-compatible bug fixes.
* Existence of a label `LABEL` represents a pre-release or build metadata.
