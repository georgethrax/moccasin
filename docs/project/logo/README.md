MOCCASIN logo
=============

The custom MOCCASIN logo was commissioned from Randy Carlton (<rcarlton@rancar2.com>) in 2015.  Note that this logo contains a portion of the trademarked ["SBML" logo](http://sbml.org/logos) (specifically, the stylized "SB").  Use of the MOCCASIN logo is limited to the MOCCASIN project and its software.
